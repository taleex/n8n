## Discord Channels

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae006b2a-99f9-4ad2-9b9a-4bc055e515b0)

This workflow automates Discord server setup by performing the following tasks:

Creates a category.
Creates two channels (one text and one voice).
Uses OpenAI to extract a JSON list of users.
Makes API calls to update and add the list of users with the correct permissions on the Discord server.

### Improvements needed
- Instead of Open AI for Json, make better loops;
- Instead manual change variable, make a chat (Probably using bubble io)
- Make it fool proof
